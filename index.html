		<p>Hey there! I'm William Woods, a software engineering student, and this is my portfolio webpage. Here, you can check out some of my current and past projects that show off my programming, software development, and problem-solving skills. I've worked on a variety of projects as a student, and this webpage is a way for me to show off my work and connect with potential employers and collaborators. Take a look around and see what I've been up to!</p>
